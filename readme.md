56 Counties, States, and Cities Just Raised Their Minimum Wage
===========

##Introduction
This interactive web map displays the current counties, states and cities that raised their minimum wage across the United States recently, according to the report from the National Employment Law Project (NELP). This map is supposed to supplement an article that covered the report, but did not include what the spatial coverage of the jurisdictions were or what the actual laws were.

##Major functions
The markers display what the current law for minimum wage is within that jurisdiction when clicked on. The intent is to have mouseover and zoomtolayer functions for the states, so that you can easily see all the points in depth and get the information readily available.

##Libraries and Data sources
The article comes from the news site Mother Jones and the data comes from a report referenced in the article, "Raises from Coast to Coast in 2022", by the National Employment Law Project. I created the geojson file for the point data by looking up coordinates for each city and county. The polygon data file comes from the Census Bureau, but I edited it to suit the needs of the minimum wage data.
